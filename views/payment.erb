<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>
  Great! Please send your XEM payment to the address encoded in the QR code below. The minimum price is <strong><%= settings.price %> XEM</strong> (~$<%= sprintf '%.2f', @usd_price %> USD), but you can pay any amount, obviously. Pay less than the asking price and your download will not be available, but you can always make up the shortfall in several separate payments (though you will pay more in transaction fees by doing this). You'll be advised on the exact value left to pay when we check for your payments in the next step.
</p>
<div class="qr-code">
  <%= @qr %>
</div>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can manually send your payment to this address:
</p>
<p>
  <textarea class="payment-address" onclick="this.select()" readonly="readonly" rows="2"><%= settings.payment_address %></textarea>
</p>
<p>
  You <strong>must</strong> include the hash below in the message field when making payment, as it is your unique purchase ID, linked to your email address, and is stored on the blockchain as part of your transaction. This will be used to confirm that your purchase has successfully been made. It may take a minute for your payment to be confirmed by nodes on the network.
</p>
<p>
  <textarea class="payment-message" onclick="this.select()" readonly="readonly" rows="2"><%= @id_hash %></textarea>
</p>
<p>
  All done? If your payment has been confirmed, please continue.
</p>
<form class="" action="/download" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="id_hash" value="<%= @id_hash %>">
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg btn-block">Next Step: Download</button>
</form>
