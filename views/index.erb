    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my experimental little app, which currently lets you buy an empty zip file using the <a href="https://www.nem.io/">NEM</a> cryptocurrency (XEM), on the NEM testnet blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>To begin, please enter your email address (don't worry, I don't save this, or any other data from you. It's just to create your own unique ID to verify your payment.)
    </p>
    <form class="email-form" action="/" method="post">
      <label for="user_email">Your Email Address:</label>
      <input type="email" class="form-control email" name="user_email" required>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg btn-block">Next Step: Payment</button>
    </form>
    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Why do you need my email address?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment your email address is solely used to provide you with a unique ID. This ID is included with your payment as a transaction message, and so is publicly available on the NEM blockchain. The app checks the blockchain for this ID, and upon successfully finding it, serves up a download button for you. In the future I might use it to email a download link to customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Can someone see my email address on the blockchain?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, your email address is one-way hashed using the SHA256 cryptographic function, and cannot be resolved from the ID hash on the blockchain transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What if I lose my download?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can return to this app at any time to receive another download. You just need to enter the email address you originally used, as your ID will match your original purchase on the blockchain. This app uses no databases, and stores no user data.
